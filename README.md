# Linux-File-Directory

Each screenshot provides a step-by-step visual guide to executing these tasks, along with annotations explaining their relevance in a real-world Linux environment. This project highlights my proficiency with Linux commands, file management, and access control mechanisms.

Feel free to explore the repository to gain insights into the practical implementation of Linux file directory management!



This project demonstrates essential Linux file directory management skills through five key tasks, documented with screenshots for clarity. 
The tasks include:
---

# Listing Files in the Home Directory
Displaying the contents of the home directory (including hidden files} to understand the structure files and other directories present.

# Working with Hidden Files
Listing hidden file ".project_x.txt" with all files and removed the "write" permission for "owner" and "group" on hidden file. Added the "read" permission to "group", to adjust access as required for hidden file.
